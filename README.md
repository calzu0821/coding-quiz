# coding-quiz

## Description
 
 This project entails the creation of a browser-based coding quiz that comprises multiple-choice questions centering around the fundamentals of JavaScript. The interface will be sleek and adaptable, featuring HTML and CSS updates that are powered by JavaScript.

The motivation behind this project is to gain familiarity with coding assessments that are often a part of the interview process. By developing this app, I can apply the skills taught in this module and evaluate my progress.

The app addresses the issue of assisting users in preparing for coding assessments by simulating a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. Furthermore, it saves high scores, allowing users to track their advancement over time.

This project has equipped me with the knowledge of manipulating HTML and CSS through JavaScript. Additionally, I have gained experience in managing events, creating functions, and dynamically updating web pages. I have also gained expertise in storing and retrieving data from local storage and displaying high scores on the app.
